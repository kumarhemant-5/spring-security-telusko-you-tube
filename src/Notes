# 1. When we are going to create software then we code and make workable by development, dev testing, QA testing and solving the bugs.
  2. Non of software in market are bug proof. But we solve most common bug and we push in production and when our client face issue then,
     we solve that bug.
  3. If our development and QA work is done then we are going to implement the security in our application.
     1. So for security we won't want to give access everyone to visit our application.
        e.g:- Suppose there is Ecommerce project where buyer has buy option and seller has sell option, so we authenticate them on use case purpose.

  4. How to implement spring security:-
     a. If we are using servlet and JSP then implementing security is big task.
        suppose if we take 10 hours to build the project then in security we have to spent 20 hours.
     b. But spring security make is easy and complete in very less time.

  5. OWASP :- Open web application security project.
     a. On every 4 years It release some security issues when is most common issues which we can face in future so developer should focus
        on them and make them secure.
     Note: - If we are not using spring then we have to fix all of them one by one.
             But when we using framework like spring security It takes care almost all the issues.
             During development It warns us to secure all the issues.


  6. To start use of spring security we have to add spring security dependency.

     a. Now when we restart the project then spring security provide a login form and default user_name= user   and  password= printed on console.
     b. Once when we login and again do login same url in other tab then It not asking for password. It get login. But when we login in
        other browser or incognito tab then It ask for password. So by this session is also mantained.
     c. for logout it provide url "/logout"
     d. we can change user_name and password through application.properties or application.yml file.









#  Agar hum Spring Security annotation ko use karen ge to ek default password dega aur bo use kar ke humlog login
   kar sakatain hain.
   - Jaise hi spring security dependency add kartain hai automaticlly ek login form milta hai
   - default user_name= user   and  password= printed on console

#  ek bar login kar ke dusare tab se login vi karen ge to login ho jayen ga isse  sessaion management vi ho jata hain.
   - ek baar login hone ke baad sare api call kar sakatain hai kyo ki session mantain rahata hain.

#  For logout
   url/logout

#  To change default password.
